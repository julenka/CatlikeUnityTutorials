# UnityTutorials
My studies with several different unity tutorials. Looking for intermediate and advanced scripting tutorials with a focus on making 
interesting meshes and shaders.

Good for me becauase I have a background in algorithms/math, and already know some Unity. I like how he highlights his code changes at every step, and includes visuals (gifs, images). Wish there were more visual explanations as some of the geometry is confusing.
